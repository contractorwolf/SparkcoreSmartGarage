SparkcoreSmartGarage
====================

This is the software for running the Sparkcore Microcontroller as an Internet of Things Smart Garage.  The full documentation and build instructions are located on my blog here:
http://contractorwolf.com/sparkcore-smart-garage/


To use this load the code in the smartgarage.ino file (in this github repo) into a new application at:
https://www.spark.io/build

The Spark.io Web IDE will then give you the DeviceID and the Authenication Token that you will then use in this code:
